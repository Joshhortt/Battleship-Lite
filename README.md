# Battleship-Lite
A small Csharp Console Game Project Application that has it's roots in the game Battleship from Mattel.
Battleship is the classic game of high-seas combat that brings together competition, strategy, and excitement. 
In head-to-head battle, you search for the enemy's fleet of ships and destroy them one by one-as you
strategically place your own ships to protect them!
